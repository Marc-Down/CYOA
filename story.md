# The Basis
Throwing the ideas into a file so I can clean it up.

Kanata, an elf with stark white hair and olive skin, grew up in a kingdom called **Monipha**. As he grew up, he was trained to fight and continue his family's history of serving in their kingdom's army.

Monipha was a kindom known for it warmongering royal family. They often would attack other kingdoms unprovoked for their land. Kanata's time in the kingdom's military was no different.

Monipha attacked a quiet woodland kingdom.

*I need to figure out a name for Ryhes's home still.*

Kanata was placed in change of a group of soldiers to protect their kingdom's villages on the outskirts of their borders. Most of their time was spent patrolling and not a lot happened within the village they were stationed in.

During this time, Kanata became particularly close with a younger soldier in the group. The soldier's name was Axel, and he was the youngest soldier in the group. Kanata felt some kind of paternal instinct towards him, and the two of them got along well.

It was a while before they saw any action during the war. Eventually a small militia from the enemy kingdom broke through to the village. The two groups were stuck in battle for a stretch of time until it ended up in a duel between their two leaders, Kanata and Ryhes.

Kanata came out of the duel victorious, killing Rhyes.
